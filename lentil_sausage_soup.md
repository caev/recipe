# LENTIL SAUSAGE SOUP
## from June Meyer

   * 3 lb. dried lentils, washed and drained
   * ~3/4 cup oil
   * 6 onions, chopped
   * 3 parsnips, chopped
   * 6 carrots, sliced
   * 3 cups sliced celery
   * 1 tsp. salt to taste
   * several whole black pepper corns
   * 6 whole cloves
   * 6 bay leaves
   * 2 sweet potatoes, scrubbed, then shredded like shredded cheese
   * 6 sausages, skin pricked once with a fork
   * enough water to fill the Tall Soup Pot (12 - 24 cups).

to serve:
   * good vinegar

In a large pot, heat oil.  saute carrots, root vegetable and onions
until onions are golden.

Wash the lentils.

Add lentils, celery, seasonings, grated potato to the sauteed vegetable pot.

Bury sausage in the lentils.  Fill pot to the top with water.  Stir it
very slightly, avoid releasing buried sausage, but get vegetables off
the bottom.  Having some clear-ish water at the bottom is necessary to
bring the whole pot up to temperature in reasonable time.

Carefully bring to a boil with the aid of the Long Science
Thermometer, then simmer 2 hours.

   * science thermometer should be in contact with the bottom of the
     bowl to forewarn of burning.  While heating up, on the bottom,
     97C - 98C is good.  99C is bad: might need to stir more to get
     stuck vegetables away.
   
   * after the top heats up (should be >80C), the temperature at the
     bottom will become less stable and, counterintuitively, go down:
     95C - 98C.

optional: Refrigerate.

Remove bay leaves and sausage.  Cut the sausage into disks and re-add it.

Serve with a splash of the good vinegar on top.
